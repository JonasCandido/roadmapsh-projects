# roadmapsh-projects
This repository contains submodules for each area of technology I'm interested in working with.<br>
The projects come from roadmap.sh website:<br>
https://roadmap.sh/

## How to run the projects
To initialize all the projects
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/JonasCandido/roadmapsh-projects
```

To initialize stack-specific projects

```
git clone https://github.com/JonasCandido/roadmapsh-projects
cd roadmapsh-projects
git submodule update --init path/to/submodule
```

After that, each README.md in each project of the stack-specific submodule will show you how to run the project
